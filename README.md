# Solution to Exercises in All of Statistics
This repo documents some of my drafted solutions to the exercises from *All of Statistics by Larry Wasserman*. This repo only contains solutions to exercises that requires computer experiment. The book is a handy tool for revision and consolidation of most concepts in statistics. The solutions are mainly written in R and formatted in Jupyter Notebook.
